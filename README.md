## ‚ú® Features
**Secure Multi-User Authentication:** A complete login/signup system ensures that all user data, including journal and mood entries, is kept private.

**Persistent Cloud Storage:** All user data is saved securely to a Google Firestore database.

**Multi-Page Interface:** A clean, navigable UI with separate sections for the daily questionnaire, a private journal, today's results, and historical trends.

**Dual-Model Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes two different transformer models for nuanced insights:

**GoEmotions** for detecting a wide range of 27 emotions.

**MentalBERT** for assessing text for signs of depression.

**Gamified Streaks:** Motivates users by tracking and displaying their consecutive daily streaks for both reflections and journal entries.

**Advanced Trend Analysis:** The "Trends" page features multiple visualizations:

A **pie chart of dominant emotions** over the last 30 days.

A **stacked area** chart comparing **positive vs. negative emotion** trends.

**AI-Generated Stories with Audio:** Uses the Google Gemini API to find and summarize a real, public domain short story from a classic author that matches the user's dominant mood. Includes a text-to-speech feature to listen to the story.

**AI-Generated Activities:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to generate personalized activities based on the user's mood, broken down into short-term, long-term, and psychological techniques.

**Multi-Language Support:** Users can select their preferred language, and the app uses the Google Gemini API to translate the interface, questions, and all generated content.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
Follow these instructions to run the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git](https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git)
cd Sentiment_Analysis

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your local secrets:
Create a folder named .streamlit in the project root, and inside it, create a file named secrets.toml. This file will hold all your secret API keys. The .gitignore file is already configured to prevent this folder from being uploaded to GitHub.

Open secrets.toml and add your keys in the following format:

## Secret key for hashing passwords (can be any random string)
SECRET_KEY = "your_strong_secret_key_here"

## Hugging Face API Key
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY = "your_hf_token_here"

## Numbered Google Gemini API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY_1 = "your_gemini_key_1"
GEMINI_API_KEY_2 = "your_gemini_key_2"

## Firebase Service Account Credentials
[firebase]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your-project-id"
### ... (copy all other fields from your Firebase JSON key file) ...
