pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Configure Your Secrets
The application uses Streamlit's secrets management. Create a file at .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your credentials.

Create the folder:

mkdir .streamlit

Create the secrets.toml file inside it and add the following content:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Hugging Face API Key (must have "Read" permissions)
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY = "hf_YourKeyHere"

# RapidAPI Key for Bhagavad Gita API
[api_keys]
rapidapi = "YourRapidAPIKeyHere"

# Generative AI Keys (add as many as you have)
GROQ_API_KEY_1 = "gsk_YourGroqKeyHere"
GEMINI_API_KEY_1 = "AIzaSy...YourGeminiKeyHere"

# Firebase Service Account Credentials
[firebase]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your-firebase-project-id"
private_key_id = "your-firebase-private-key-id"
private_key = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourPrivateKeyHere\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"""
client_email = "your-firebase-client-email"
client_id = "your-firebase-client-id"
auth_uri = "[https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth)"
token_uri = "[https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token](https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token)"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "[https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs](https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs)"
client_x509_cert_url = "your-firebase-cert-url"

### 6. Run the Application
Once your secrets are configured, you can run the app with a single command:

streamlit run App.py

The application should now be running in your web browser!
